# Usage

Archway can be used for:
* installing **Arch(-based distros)** with UEFI or BIOS.
* making a **chroot** with some tweaks.

Archway cannot be used for:
* installing **unsupported** operating systems such as Fedora, Redhat, Gentoo and Chrom* OS. Arch is currently the only system supported.
* installing **non-GNU/Linux** systems such as Windows, macOS, Android and i(Pad)OS. These systems are built without manual install steps like command line instructions.
* installing a normal **package** to a system through a live CD. You will need to chroot into the system and install the package manually.
* installing systems **onto one disk**. To do this, you will need to manually run Archway to each partition.
* setting up a system and **adding support** for desktop, Xorg, LAMP, etc. Again, you must chroot into the system.
